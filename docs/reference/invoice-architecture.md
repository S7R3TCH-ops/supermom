### Invoice architecture
- Public route: `/i/:id` — no auth required (shareable link)
- `src/pages/InvoiceView.jsx` — web preview. "Download PDF" → `GET /api/invoice?id=`. "Print" → `window.print()`.
- `src/data/invoicesRepo.js` — `generateInvoiceForJob(jobId)`, `fetchInvoiceById(id)`, `fetchInvoices()`, `settleInvoiceOutstanding()`, `voidInvoiceSettlement()`, `addJobsToInvoice()`
- `api/invoice.js` — GET `?id=<invoiceId>` → PDF download; POST → email send. Env vars: `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`. Filename: `LastName_Invoice_YYYY-NNN.pdf` or `LastName_Receipt_YYYY-NNN.pdf`.
- `api/_lib/invoicePdf.ts` — react-pdf builder. Address blocks use single `<Text>` with `\n`-joined children — **intentional**; stacked `<Text>` elements each get their own font-metrics line-box.
- Logo files: `logo-banner.png` (app bar) vs `logo-final-white-bg.png` (invoice/email, 492KB, white background) — never mix. `logo-final-tansparent.png` is a separate transparent-bg export, cut for a realtor of Sandra's to use on her own website — not used anywhere in-app.
- Settlement payments tagged `payments.invoice_id = <this invoice>` so `decorateInvoiceWithBalances` finds jobs paid via this invoice. Multi-job invoices supported: `decorateInvoiceWithBalances` aggregates across all `invoice_jobs`; `invoiceJobBalances[]` exposed. Single-job assumption removed in v0.12.67.
